def main():
  x, y = 110, 100
  
  # conditional flow uses if, elif, else  
  if (x < y):
    # This code is the comparison of x with y, we are looking to return 
    # true in instances where x is a smaller value than y,
    # if this is false then the indented code will not be executed
    st = "x is less than y"
    # print("Answer : ", st )
    #now we may want within the conditional bounds to be the assigment
    #meaning we always want st to be printed but the value given
    #and therefore the value printed should change
    #we can use an if else statement which will allow us to change st
    #then outside the if statment we print st
  elif(x > y):
    st = "x is more than y"
  else:
    st = "x is equal to y"
  print("Answer : ", st)
  # conditional statements let you use "a if C else b"
  #below is the tunary equv 
  st = "x is less than y" if (x<y) else "x is greater than or equal to"
  print("Answer 2: ", st)
#python makes use of if statements, it doesnt make use of switch conditions

#python allows for singular condition statement, this is similiar to tunary
# it is show above
