# Python
This is the basic knowledge of use of python.

python is a multiparadigm (), general purpose, interpretated, high level programming language. python allows the use of multiple programming styles in order to create a simple or complex program. It allows for quicker results and easy to use/write code creating an enviroment more similair to the human language.
Some well known uses of python can be seen within google search, Youtube, ButTorrent etc.
Pythons initial development was in the late 1980s, as python is multiparadigm is allows different styles of pogramming to be used to accomplish a task. These include object orientated programming, imperative, functional or reflective.

OBJECT ORIENTATED PROGRAMMING -> This is a programming language model organised around object rather than actions, and data rather than logic. usually we see programming as a logical procedure; takes an input, processes it and produces the output. OBB programming looks more into the object we would like to manipulate rather than the logic required. Examples of objects include human beings which are described by name, address and so forth. The first thing to do in OOP is to identify all the objects that a programmer will want to manupulate. and then how they can relate to one another. This excercise is often known as data modelling. Once an object is indentified it is generalised as a class. we then define the the kind of data it will contain and the logic seqeunces to manipulate it. Each seqeunce is called a mthod within the class.
-- Classes allow for the definition of sub classes and to acheive inheritance. This allows properties and methods to be in inherited from a parent class. this helps to reduce development time, and acheives better refactoring and more accurate code.
-- As a class will only define the data which it is concerned with, when an instance of the class is run. Only the data which is relevant can be used and manipulated. Improving security and limiting unitended data corruption 
Python, C++, Visual Basic, .Net, Java and Ruby are the most popular examples of OOP.
benefits of OOP 
  *Modular Structure
  *Reusable 
  *Easier to Maintain
  *Easier to Develop 
  
  IMPERATIVE PROGRAMMING -> Declrative programming is used in describing what the program should do, imperative  is the definition of how a computer should accomplish it. The functions are coded in every step required to solve a problem. This is the requirement of unsteanding 
  and providing a step by step guide as to how a problem should be accomplished. As the written code performs the functions instead of models, the programmer must code each step. Langauges include pythin, C, C++, Java. The alterative is declerative these are languages suh as SQL, X query ie database query languages.
  
  FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING -> functional programming is "a method for structuring programs mainly as sequences of possibly nested function procedure calls." A function procedure is a relatively simple program that is called by other programs and derives and returns a value to the program that called it.

  -- WHEN TO USE PYTHON
  *At present, Python is supports many operating systems. You can even use Python interpreters to run the code on specific platforms and tools. Also, Python is an interpreted programming language. It allows you to you to run the same code on multiple platforms without recompilation. Hence, you are not required to recompile the code after making any alteration
  *Its large and robust standard library makes Python score over other programming languages. The standard library allows you to choose from a wide range of modules according to your precise needs. Each module further enables you to add functionality to the Python application without writing additional code. For instance, while writing a web application in Python, you can use specific modules to implement web services, perform string operations, manage operating system interface or work with internet protocols.
  *As an open source programming language, Python helps you to curtail software development cost significantly. You can even use several open source Python frameworks, libraries and development tools to curtail development time without increasing development cost. You even have option to choose from a wide range of open source Python frameworks and development tools according to your precise needs. For instance, you can simplify and speedup web application development by using robust Python web frameworks like Django, Flask, Pyramid, Bottle and Cherrypy. Likewise, you can accelerate desktop GUI application development using Python GUI frameworks and toolkits like PyQT, PyJs, PyGUI, Kivy, PyGTK and WxPython.
  *Python is a general purpose programming language. Hence, you can use the programming language for developing both desktop and web applications. Also, you can use Python for developing complex scientific and numeric applications. Python is designed with features to facilitate data analysis and visualization. You can take advantage of the data analysis features of Python to create custom big data solutions without putting extra time and effort. At the same time, the data visualization libraries and APIs provided by Python help you to visualize and present data in a more appealing and effective way. Many Python developers even use Python to accomplish artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing tasks.
  *You can use Python to create prototype of the software application rapidly. Also, you can build the software application directly from the prototype simply by refactoring the Python code. Python even makes it easier for you to perform coding and testing simultaneously by adopting test driven development (TDD) approach. You can easily write the required tests before writing code and use the tests to assess the application code continuously. The tests can also be used for checking if the application meets predefined requirements based on its source code.
  
ISSUES OF PYTHON 
It lacks some of the built-in features provided by other modern programming language. Hence, you have to use Python libraries, modules, and frameworks to accelerate custom software development. Also, several studies have shown that Python is slower than several widely used programming languages including Java and C++. You have to speed up the Python application by making changes to the application code or using custom runtime. But you can always use Python to speed up software development and simplify software maintenance.
